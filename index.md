Hi, I am Kwame, originally from Ghana living and working in Japan

AI and ML has been to me the elusive Mt. Fuji of knowledge, with promises of great views from its summit, and even greater difficulties for those who dare to conquer it.

I **AM** going to conquer this mountain (Famous lastwords, I know).

Come, live vicariously through me as I immortalize my tales of conquest through blog.
